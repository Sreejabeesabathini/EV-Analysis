Electric Vehicle Dashboard - PowerBI
Welcome to the Electric Vehicle Dashboard project! This project utilizes PowerBI to create a comprehensive and insightful dashboard that analyzes and visualizes various key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts related to electric vehicles (EVs). The dataset focuses on both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), offering valuable insights into the market trends, technological advancements, and adoption patterns of EVs.

Project Overview
This project covers the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts related to the electric vehicle landscape:

KPIs
Total Vehicles: Displays the overall size and growth of the electric vehicle market by counting both BEVs and PHEVs.

Average Electric Range: Computes the average electric range of the EVs in the dataset, highlighting the technological advancements in the sector.

Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles: Provides insights into the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and their percentage of the overall market.

Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles: Analyzes the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and their percentage of the total market.

Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following visualizations to provide insights into the electric vehicle market:

Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards)

Chart Type: Line/Area Chart

Description: This chart displays the distribution of electric vehicles across model years, highlighting growth trends and adoption patterns since 2010.

Total Vehicles by State

Chart Type: Map Chart

Description: A geographical map that visualizes the distribution of electric vehicles across different states, helping to identify regions with higher EV adoption.

Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make

Chart Type: Bar Chart

Description: A bar chart that showcases the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers, providing insights into which brands dominate the market.

Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility

Chart Type: Pie Chart or Donut Chart

Description: This chart shows the proportion of electric vehicles eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, offering insights into the effect of incentives on EV adoption.

Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model

Chart Type: Tree Map

Description: A tree map that highlights the top 10 electric vehicle models, illustrating consumer preferences and the most popular models on the market.

Dataset Overview
This dashboard is built using a dataset containing various attributes of electric vehicles, including make, model, year, range, state, and more. The dataset is used to calculate the KPIs and generate the visualizations that offer insights into the EV market's trends and patterns.

PowerBI Features Used
Data Modeling: The dataset was transformed and modeled within PowerBI to facilitate KPI calculations and visualizations.

DAX Calculations: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used to compute key metrics such as the total number of vehicles, the percentage of BEVs and PHEVs, and the average electric range.

Interactive Dashboards: The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter data by various dimensions such as year, state, make, and model to explore the dataset further.

Visual Elements: A combination of line charts, bar charts, tree maps, map charts, and pie charts/donut charts were used to effectively communicate insights.

How to Use the Dashboard
Open the PowerBI file to interact with the dashboard.

Use slicers to filter data by variables such as model year, state, and make.
